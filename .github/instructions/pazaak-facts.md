# Pazaak Card Game Rules and Facts

- Types of Decks: Pazaak uses two types of decks: a shared main deck and individual side decks for each player.
- Number of Decks: One main deck is shared, and each player has one side deck, so for a two-player game, there are typically three decks in total (one main + two side decks).
- Main Deck Details: Contains 40 cards (four sets of cards numbered 1-10); all cards are green and valued from 1 to 10; owned by the cantina or house and used for drawing during play to build the base score.
- Side Deck Details: Each player has a side deck of 10 special cards; 4 cards are randomly drawn from it at the start to form the player's hand, which remains fixed for the game.
- Cards per Player: Each player uses 4 cards from their side deck as their hand; these are single-use per game for adjustments.
- Decks Used per Player: One side deck per player (10 cards total, 4 in hand); players share the main deck.
- Total Decks per Entire Game: Three decks for a standard two-player game (one shared main deck + one side deck per player).
- Categories and Types of Cards in Main Deck: Only numbered cards valued 1-10 (green).
- Categories and Types of Cards in Side Deck: Blue plus cards (+1 to +6, add positive points, 4x each = 24 cards); red minus cards (-1 to -6, subtract points, 4x each = 24 cards); plus or minus cards (±1 to ±6, player chooses add or subtract, 4x each = 24 cards); flip cards (2&4 flip reverses signs of all 2s and 4s on the board, 4x cards; 3&6 flip reverses signs of all 3s and 6s, 4x cards = 8 total flip cards); double card (D, doubles the value of the last main deck card drawn, 2x cards); tiebreaker card (T, valued +1 or -1, used to win tied rounds, 2x cards); plus or minus 1 or 2 card (±1/2, playable as +1, -1, +2, or -2, 2x cards).
- Colors of Cards: Main deck: all green; side deck: blue for plus/positive cards (24 cards), red for minus/negative cards (24 cards), red/blue (half red, half blue) for dual plus/minus cards (24 cards); yellow for flip cards (8 cards) and special cards (6 cards: 2x double, 2x tiebreaker, 2x variable).
- Game Board: A 3x3 grid (9 spaces) per player; cards are placed left to right, top to bottom.
- Turns: Players alternate turns; each turn involves drawing one card from the main deck and optionally playing one card from the hand (only one hand card per turn).
- Rounds (Sets): Each round (also called a set) ends when both players stand, one busts, or the board fills; the player with the highest score ≤20 wins the round; busting (over 20) loses the round; ties without a tiebreaker card result in a void round that must be restarted and doesn't count.
- Matches (Full Game): The overall game is a match won by the first player to win three rounds.
- Additional Numerical Details: Objective is to reach exactly 20 or as close as possible without exceeding; automatic stand on exactly 20; hand cards are limited to 4 per player per game and are strategic for adjustments.
