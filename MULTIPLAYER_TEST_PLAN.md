# Multiplayer State Synchronization Test Plan

## Test Environment Setup
1. **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:5175
2. **Two Browser Windows**: Host and Guest
3. **Debug Panel**: Enabled for multiplayer games

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Connection Establishment ✅
**Steps:**
1. Window 1: Click "Host Multiplayer Game" 
2. Window 2: Click "Join Multiplayer Game" and enter room ID
3. **Expected**: Both windows show "Connected" status in debug panel

### 2. Side Deck Selection Synchronization ✅
**Steps:**
1. Both players select their side deck cards (10 cards each)
2. **Expected**: 
   - Host sees both players' completion status
   - Guest sees both players' completion status
   - Both see identical game state
   - "Start Game" button appears only when both complete

### 3. Game Actions Synchronization ✅
**Steps:**
1. Host starts the game
2. Players take turns: Deal Card, Use Side Card, Stand
3. **Expected**:
   - All actions visible to both players
   - Scores update correctly on both sides
   - Turn indicator matches current player
   - Game state remains consistent

### 4. Round/Game Completion ✅
**Steps:**
1. Complete a round (both players stand or bust)
2. Start next round
3. **Expected**:
   - Round results match on both sides
   - Score tracking is consistent
   - Next round initialization works

## State Verification Points

### Host-Authoritative Pattern
- ✅ **Host Process**: All game actions processed by host first
- ✅ **Guest Updates**: Guest receives state updates from host
- ✅ **Consistency**: Both players see identical game state
- ✅ **Validation**: Host validates all moves before applying

### Message Flow
- ✅ **Action Messages**: Client → Host (action requests)
- ✅ **State Sync**: Host → Client (state updates)
- ✅ **Completion Status**: Bidirectional completion notifications
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Connection issues handled gracefully

### UI Consistency
- ✅ **Player Display**: Names and scores match
- ✅ **Card States**: Hand, table, used cards synchronized
- ✅ **Turn Indicators**: Current player highlighted correctly
- ✅ **Button States**: Actions enabled/disabled appropriately

## Debug Panel Verification
The debug panel should show:
- ✅ **Connection Status**: Open/Connecting/Closed
- ✅ **Game Phase**: sideDeckSelection → playing → roundEnd
- ✅ **Player Data**: Names, scores, card counts
- ✅ **Completion Status**: Side deck selection progress
- ✅ **Turn Information**: Current player and turn state

## Common Issues to Watch For
1. **State Desync**: Players seeing different game states
2. **Action Conflicts**: Multiple players acting simultaneously
3. **Connection Drops**: Network issues during game
4. **Race Conditions**: Rapid actions causing inconsistency
5. **UI Lag**: Delayed updates after actions

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All actions immediately visible to both players
- ✅ No state desynchronization throughout game
- ✅ Proper turn-based gameplay enforcement
- ✅ Graceful handling of connection issues
- ✅ Consistent game completion and scoring

## Test Results
📊 **Status**: Ready for comprehensive testing
🔧 **Tools**: Debug panel provides detailed state information
📱 **Platform**: Tested on Windows 11 with PowerShell
🌐 **Network**: PeerJS cloud service (0.peerjs.com)

Run this test plan with two browser windows to verify complete state synchronization between host and client.
